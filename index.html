    <p>I just love coding. It's so fun. We learn so much.The definition of coding is the process of creating instructions for computers using programming languages. Computer code is used to program the websites, apps, and other technologies we interact with every day. Coding is not hard to learn. If you take the time and have a lot of patience, you can really learn just about anything. ... Learning to code takes a good amount of time and persistence, but if you have those then we guarantee you'll get there.coding is not hard to learn. ... While learning might require them to tap into areas with which they don't have prior familiarity, those who have the time, persistence, and dedication can start gaining coding experience just as they can learn to do something else.This is what I wanted to share of my experience . Bye!!!</p>
